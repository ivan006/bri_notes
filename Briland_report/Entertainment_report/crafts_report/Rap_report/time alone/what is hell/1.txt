Hell isnt what you think



So Michelle will u tell why ur the queen of hell?

Cause she fell recently (use to be “as a girl”) right down the wishing well

Down to hell had a dwell and liked the vibe smell

Asked to stay the devil said that all would be well



She says that (use to be “most don’t know”) hell is really and engine of life

With one half fire and the other half is ice

If u were to live there it wouldn’t be so nice

But when fire meets ice oh it’s such a delight



In between is a steam that forms into a stream

So pristine that the queen sees the scene in her dreams

When she thinks on these themes then she bursts at the seams

It’s supreme how she so highly deems such a scene



So she’s there underground in the realms that she’s found

But struggles to be proud or even say aloud

Cause if news got around of this how would it sound

Cause this mystical place is so shrouded in cloud



But it’s more innocent than what most people think

if it weren’t for hells springs then how would people drink?

Christianity has made hell sound like a stink

”Oh I know” said Michelle “I’ll change the way we think”



First to change is the name hell sound way to obtuse

This campaign will contain and reflect the real truth

From what I have seen this is the cradle of youth

So the cradle of youth is the new name to use



So hell’s  reputation was far too depleted 

But despite how she pleaded no one believed it

now the debates heated she won’t be defeated

Or even impeded till her jobs completed



So Michelle will u tell what it’s like at life’s source?

Is it hellish and brutish as some might endorse

Do you sweat while you toil and feel a deep remorse?

Or do you feel lucky to be tending lifes force





Oh sweet Michelle

Why r u
Why r u

Queen of hell
(Follow tune from “I saw her laugh and she said and she said go away, away)



Oh sweet Michelle 

What does your 

What does your

New life entail?




Since Michelle broke up with me I’ve been trying to make sense of where everyone stands.



With the lack of information she’s given me she could stand in hell for all i know
