Yo yo hi my names guy my name fry no I lie
But who cares and who dares I'll just die then you'll cry
There's no time to explain who I am call me pie
I'm a song song along if you can't well just try

What context does this text and what hex and what's next?
Don't accept be upset and just fret but don't let 
money get to ur head when in bed in ur nest
It infest don't ingest what is said by the rest

Be awake be aware  if you dare there's no snake
In this earth it's just love and its real its not fake
It's inside your eyes big surprise for God sake
Here's a list of some things to help you to create

It's a list some morals some ethics for business
God bless the economy let he atmosphere shift
We can function with this corruption hit and miss
Too much fist so I'm pissed so listen I insist

Number one honesty itâ€™s the best policy
So don't play hide and seek and don't lie and don't cheat
Reach inside when you speak spread the love when you preach
It's a big lesson for me to teach honesty

Number two integrity get your shit together
More integrity please don't just say whatever
We'll whether the weather whatever the weather
If we try and we fail we still got a tether

Number three try to be trustworthy it's the key
So only try agree to vows you plan to keep
You owe me property sign over those de-deed
When I lend you money I expect guarantees

Number four loyalty don't be so divided
If we split up right now we could end up de-dead
There is strength in numbers get this shit in you head
United we are strong we are healed we are fed
