we build our lives with one of two approaches 
one makes your life good the other one atrocious 
they got long names so i'll give them in small doses
let's shorten object-centrism to o-focus

subject-centrism to s-focus that's the name
o-focus and s-focus are the two main games
o-focus the one i'd like to give the acclaim
As i think that s-focus can only bring pain

So o-focus is like materialism
which isn't evil that's just some broken wisdom
they say that wealth is evil to cloud your vision
putting you under the spell of mysticism

s-focus is just like celebrity worship
don't waste your time on that rather worship corn chips
so rather come equipped so you don't have to slip
celebrities wont help you in times of hardship


x2 chorus
some say the way we see forms our long destiny
political theory shapes how we live and breathe


celebrity worship is giving up power
this does nothing but make society sour
lets build harmony so no one has to cower
let this clean society like a good shower

they say life is in the eye of the perceiver
lets be more scientific im needing a breather
life is real whether you do or don't believe it
but that doesn't mean we cant be achievers

acknowledge that there's more than our bodies and minds
there's our spirit which lies in our roadways and mines
so don't just leave the things we make on the sidelines
what we make is divine like our linens and wines

if we shift to o-focus we'll have harmony
let's shift our focus from people to assets please
i don't say this cause my hearts infected with greed
i say it cause we all have a tummy to feed


x2 chorus
some say the way we see forms our long destiny
political theory shapes how we live and breathe
