Love and Fear - The Rap:

religion talks a lot about heaven,
but then treat us all like we their peasants
making our lives hellish and unpleasant,
so now I bring you a brand new lesson

for so long we've endured an age of fear,
relying on deities far and near
who demand worship and to be held dear
to only consider ourselves as mere

but just wait there is coming a new age
where love and equality set the stage
it will be just like turning a new page
where peace will come and wars will cease to wage

The power of the word will be unlocked
to replace the powers that must be blocked
the powers that like guns were always cocked
as thought and deed result in someone mocked

the powers of thought and deed had their day,
but now its time for words to show the way
you could even say it's our destiny,
its built deep within our philosophy

they say love is equality and strength
and with it we can surely reach great length
fear's inequality, weakness and dense
it even limits us and makes us tense

love is objective and we all chip in
where we can peacefully debate on things
where we don't just have to obey some king
and scientific fact is what it brings

fear is I say jump and you say how high
and it's all about some guy in the sky
and your kings opinion can't be denied
though it's subjective on it, we rely

but objective science models can be taught
there's a model to use when truth is sought
its a model I made and can support
its supports me helping me with my thought

Firstly, it divides the world into groups
for its in group in which we get our truth,
whether family or business with suits
or your friendship circles that start at youth,

then inside this element you will find
where group hold various products with pride,
then after groups and products are untied
is where the great project is held inside

the next two deeper level elements
are project-versions and then departments
finally recourses is the last hint
thus life is engineered like filaments

I'm sorry to get so technical here
this might not be very simply to hear
you may even say that this stuff sounds weird,
but this kind of stuff gets me right in gear

so now to conclude all of what I said
your records are like butter to your bread
words and information keep your mouth fed
your outlook can keep u or make u dead

history is about to make a turn
love is about to openly be learned
we will live the life that we all have yearned
where all our strife we had will be adjourned

It's time to take responsibility
I invite you to live your destiny
so get up, stand up for out rights with me
lets discuss it over a cup of tea
