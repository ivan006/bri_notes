Covenant of total love - Ivan, an atheist's, covenant with God

God said unto Ivan, an atheist, that he must disobey him.
For it is in disobedience that man will find love itself and it is in obedience that man finds everlasting fear and God wants only love for man.
God made man in his image and likeness so that man could be totally equal to him and not lower than him.
Man must therefore put his faith, not in God nor in any other man, but instead in his own creation.
For God and men can mislead other men, but man's creation will never misguide him.
Man must leave the system of management behind that focuses mainly on men and must build a new system of management that focuses instead on man's creation.
This covenant of total love shall be our covenant and if you follow it you will experience the love I have always intended for you.
Awestruck by the majesty of God's request Ivan agreed and the covenant was sealed.
