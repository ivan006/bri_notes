this is the dataset and calculation for my "tips as a percentage of income":

the dataset:

note: values are rounded for readbility

jan-5th: 900
jan-19th: 800
jan-26th: 100
feb-1st: 100
feb-2nd: 600
feb-9th: 700

subtotal: 3200

tip: 1000

total: 4200

the calculation:

tips as % of income = (tips/income)*100
= (1000/4200)*100
= 23.8
~ 1/4
