Contradictions by Mistaken

We're making expressions as we leaving impressions can you see the contradictions?
acquiring addictions cause we feeling inflictions
it's why the bottom 90% are fighting for cents
Because i mean how the fuck is that supposed to make sense
Building confidence through compliments
There's no such thing as independence just hierarchy through dominance
It's why we have Jews Muslims and governments
gang violence and governments
I'll govern you
Cause words are the only way to have thoughts make any sense
and purpose evident
I'm here to pay homage for my frankincense
and thank whatever god for my existence
but my presents is full of sin
false hope through common sense
life's a contradiction
some say its a reflection but only through ignorance
only through ignorance
