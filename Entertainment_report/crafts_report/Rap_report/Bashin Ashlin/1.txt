~Ashlin by The Evil One~

Yo these thoughts I can't manage, i'm causing damage
Throw this bitch off my carriage so she miscarriage
She wanted marriage, got chainsaw from my garage
Got nails for her coffin, so I could pay hamage

She screamed in alarm, cause I was grabbing her arm
Tried to drag her to farmer browns barn on his farm
Sit her down on an armchair to spin me some yarn
Said if you just keep calm, I wont cause you no harm

One look at my grin made her want to fight and win
So I scavenged her bin in search of something
Went straight to the bottom of it and found a ring
Then went back to the farm to show of my new bling

She said do you want kids? I said none yo business
Put it on your wish-list, and go do the dishes
Now that she's my mistress, god she thinks its Christmas
I'm the snake don't mistake the hisses for kisses

I am the puppet master causing disaster
Call up the witch doctor to get you a plaster
Play chicken faster and faster till we crasha
And in a flash we're mashed up now call the paster

Got a restraining order from all your daughters
Locked up to contemplate, plot and scheme they forced us
And I'm still struggling to choress the chorus
Cause im still petrified of horrors like horus

All seeing eye big brother, makes me want to cry
I get the shudders when “the others” pass me by
All alone on my island I look at the sky
When will the bitch in the barn spin me wings to fly?

Her name is Ashlin I love her with a passion
But to express my feelings is not my fashion
Thats why when I drive my racecar I'm crash landing
Maybe my brain my mind needs handling expanding

Its time I jump start my life yeah and start to write
Pen is miightier than the sword so pass the light
Cause in thus day and age this is the way we fight
So open wide for some new insight no big fright

Its just smoke an mirrors and flashes and dashes
Thats what you get when the opposite sex clashes
But hell is a humans only rites of passage
Must walk through the room and smell the fumes and gasses

Stop you don't have to be a chip off the old block
Things always change remember magma was once rock?
And so does logic so in the end that's fuck spock
He's an imposter in the live long prosper flock

So why do you suck so hard while I just spit bars?
Even Eminem can do it its not that hard
In fact fuck politics you can go full retard
Just describe your scars like they're the heaven and stars
