the dot com bubble is an example of our inablility
to prodently valuate assets.

the dot com bubble failure came  from our 
invetment banking model and the internet itself 
is not to blame.

our faulty investment banking model reflects
a deeper seeded issue that of general human 
awareness

wih more prudnet valuation its clear that 
genera IQ has dramatically increase since 
the internets inception.

and so it seems that the internet can increase
general human awareness even to the extent
that it could fix our faulty investment banking 
model as to avoid any future asset bubbles of 
any sort.
