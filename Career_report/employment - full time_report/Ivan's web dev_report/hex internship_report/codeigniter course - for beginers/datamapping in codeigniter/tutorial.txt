What are models?

	Models are the folders where "data mapping" functions are found which are for 
	handling your database.

What is CodeIgniter SQL?

	SQL is a special language used to communicate with the database.
	Although SQL is used in CodeIgniter you wont directly code with it instead you 
	will use CodeIgniters shorthand (also known as query builder functions).

ORM's

	What is an ORM?

	ORM (object-relational mapping) is the type of data mapping that allows us to
	handle bits of relational data as unified hierarchical data objects.

	How to make an ORM?

	There are couple of different methods ORMs use 
	1. the adjecency list method (where you just add a field to the objects saying 
	who their parent is.)
	2. the nested list method (where you use some numbers according to some numbering 
	system and advanced calculus to determine the structure) and 
	3. the closure tables method (where you use an associative table to describe the 
	structure, like they use in WordPress). 


What is a repository?

	Repositories are connected to the DBAL (database absraction layer) in that they 
	both contribute to making CodeIgniter's database communication shorthand possible.

What is an entity?

	Entities are connected to the ORM in that they both help in representating youe 
	database.
