Hey Nanny and Grandad 

What shall i say? 
I guess what is most interesting for me to talk about is my career. 
My career is developing and i am currently an intern at a small website company. 
It's basically marketing but using the internet. 
It's very exciting and also scary at times. 
I have been at this company for about a month and our project so far have been for: 
1. a couple of spiritual churches (like the one mum and dad use to live at in glastonbury) 
2. the X-ray association of South Africa 
3. a charity 
4. and some health product companies 
I can apparently earn a lot of money in this career. 
So thats all i have to say that is that interesting. 
Rachel told me that the best way to communicate with u guys is to phone you, so i will do that sometime soon. 
Love you lots.
