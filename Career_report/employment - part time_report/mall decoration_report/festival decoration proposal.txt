Dear Sir/Madam

My name is Ivan Copeland
I would love to help setup your decorations. 
I am very enthusiastic to get as much work experience as possible. 

I see myself as an enthusiastic and motivated individual.
I am very good at crafts. 
I once help make the decor for the festival Rocking the Daisies. 
I did a lot of art and crafts at school as I went to the creative school Constatia Waldorf.
I am studying to be a web developer and there is a lot of visual design in that feild too.

I am grateful for the opportunity to make this proposal.
Looking forwarding to hearing back from you.

Kind regards
Ivan
