An income tax return has been generated for you containing the latest employee 
tax certificate [IRP5/IT3(a)] information that SARS has received for you from 
your employer/s. If your return does not contain all your tax certificate 
information it means that:
1. Either your employer/s has not yet submitted this information to SARS or
2. SARS is unable to match you to a tax certificate/s due to incomplete or 
inaccurate information on these certificates (e.g. it does not contain your 
ID or tax reference number).

SARS recommends that in such cases you do not file this return and rather try 
again later by refreshing your IRP5 data on the Income Tax Work page.

If you choose to file this return, please be advised that the processing of 
this return may be significantly delayed and you may be required to submit 
supporting documentation.

Please note that all address details  (both physical and postal) must be those 
of the Taxpayer and not those of a Tax Practitioner.
